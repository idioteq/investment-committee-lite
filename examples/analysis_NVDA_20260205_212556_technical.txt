10. ENTRY/EXIT TIMING ASSESSMENT

- RSI not deeply oversold but near bottom zone  
- Recommended entry range: $168-$172 (near 200-day SMA support)  
- Stop-loss: Below $165 would protect against breakdown below support  
- Take-profit targets: $183 (50-day SMA), then $195 (upper Bollinger)  
- Risk/reward: Moderate; downside limited near 200-day SMA, upside to 50-day SMA and upper Bollinger band  

11. TECHNICAL THESIS SUMMARY  
- Overall picture: Neutral to slightly bearish short term, bullish long term  
- Recommendation: Wait for price stability near 200-day SMA and RSI to confirm stronger reversal before buying aggressively  
- Technical drivers: Golden cross provides bullish backbone; bearish MACD and price below 50 SMA indicate short-term weakness  
- Major risks: Breakdown below 200-day SMA could lead to further selloff  

Summary: NVDA shows signs of short-term weakness with momentum indicators near oversold but supported by long-term bullish moving average configuration. Momentum and price volatility are elevated. Entry near the 200-day SMA with tight stop-loss offers a reasonable risk/reward tradeoff. Current market conditions suggest caution rather than immediate aggressive buy.

Confidence is medium due to incomplete volume and price action granularity in the data.
