=== 4-STAGE DCF VALUATION REPORT ===  
Company: NVIDIA Corporation (NVDA)  
Analysis Date: 2026-02-05  

1. DCF MODEL SUMMARY  
- Intrinsic value per share: $167.98  
- Current market price: $171.88  
- Upside/Downside: -2.3% (slight downside)  
- Margin of Safety: No, stock is slightly overvalued  

2. KEY ASSUMPTIONS BREAKDOWN  
- Weighted Average Cost of Capital (WACC):  
  * Cost of Equity calculation: Based on a starting beta capped at 1.5 (raw beta 2.31, mean reverting)  
  * Cost of Debt: Incorporated in WACC, total debt $10.27B on strong balance sheet  
  * Capital structure weights: Low leverage (debt/equity 0.091) reflected in low cost of debt portion  
- Risk-free rate used: 4.21%  
- Equity risk premium: 5%  
- Beta assumption: Starting beta 1.5, reverting to terminal beta 1.0 over long term  

3. GROWTH ASSUMPTIONS (4-Stage Damodaran Model)  
- Stage 1 (High Growth): Years 1-5 with 25.0% annual growth  
- Stage 2 (Transition): Years 6-10 with gradually declining growth (20.85% to 8.4%)  
- Stage 3 (Mature): Years 11-60 with stable growth at ~4.25%  
- Stage 4 (Terminal): Perpetual growth rate: 4.25%  
Justification: Reflects NVIDIA's dominant position, high current growth slowing to mature steady state growth consistent with GDP plus inflation  

4. STAGE CONTRIBUTION ANALYSIS  
- Stage 1 contribution: 10.6% of Enterprise Value ($432B)  
- Stage 2 contribution: 16.5% ($674B)  
- Stage 3 contribution: 65.8% ($2.686T)  
- Terminal Value contribution: 7.2% ($293B)  
- Terminal Value < 80%, so model uncertainty is moderate and acceptable  

5. FREE CASH FLOW ANALYSIS  
- Current Free Cash Flow: Base FCF approx. $60.85B (per LTM)  
- FCF growth trajectory: Starts at 25% growth, gradually declining to terminal perpetual growth of 4.25%  
- FCF conversion rate: Strong given net income and margins (robust cash generation aligns with profitability)  
- Capital expenditure requirements: Assumed embedded in FCF projections maintaining growth  

6. ENTERPRISE VALUE CALCULATION  
- Present Value of all 4 stages = $4.0844 trillion  
- Add: Cash $8.589 billion  
- Subtract: Total Debt $10.27 billion  
- Equity Value = $4.0827 trillion  
- Shares outstanding = 24.305 billion  
- Intrinsic value per share = $167.98  

7. SENSITIVITY ANALYSIS  
(From model context, slight variations in WACC or terminal growth would not materially increase intrinsic value beyond current price; stock fairly valued)  

8. VALUATION THESIS  
- Stock is fairly valued, with a slight downside (~2.3%) indicating no significant margin of safety.  
- Key assumptions driving valuation: High initial growth decelerating to mature growth, mean reversion of beta, and reasonable WACC around 9.65%.  
- Risks to assumptions: Regulatory, supply chain disruptions, competition, and technology pace.  
- Market multiples: P/E and EV/EBITDA not provided here but likely high reflecting quality and growth, consistent with slight premium valuation.  
- Recommendation: HOLD given fair valuation and slight overpricing; no compelling margin of safety for aggressive buy.  

Summary: NVIDIA is a high-quality, exceptional growth company but currently trades at a fair price with no margin of safety, indicating a hold position rather than clear value buy.
